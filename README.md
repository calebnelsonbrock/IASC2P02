# IASC 2P02 Caleb Nelson Bio
My name is Caleb Nelson and am currently a second year student at Brock University. Hobbies include graphics design, video games and football (American football, not soccer).

For now, my major is Interactive Arts and Science and am currently in my second year. I have had a change of heart for what I want to do and plan to switch schools and programs. With that said I want to be building computers for a living or work for any large computer company, from NVidia to MSI. Although in the requirements it says to assume I will continue in this field, I truly believe I have no place in the digital humanities. I am a hands-on creator, I like to build things, not think about how theyâ€™re built or how they were invented, etc.
